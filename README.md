# Weather App

## A simple weather webapp made in React Js

Started in 15/8/2021

**This is only the first version, however, the next (improved) version will contain automated tests with jest, comments and a better responsive design, in addition to more features...**

_Note :_ this project took me a little bit more than a week to complete because of frontend issues and
getting used to new technologies like axios and async/await in addition to some limitations when it comes
the api that was used to fetch weather data (Accu Weather Api)
